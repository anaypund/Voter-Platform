Election Voter Search & Slip Printing Platform

Objective - 

Design and develop a mobile-responsive, simple, ultra-fast voter lookup and slip-printing portal used by political party workers during elections.

The platform allows party members to search voter records, verify identities, and generate printable voter slips instantly, even when data is written in Marathi / Hindi / English with spelling inconsistencies.

Search System

Search Type 2: Person Search (Smart Fuzzy Search)

Smart Matching Logic

Because data in database exists in Marathi / Hindi / English and often misspelled, system must:

1. Normalize user input
2. Apply phonetic fuzzy matching
3. Support Devanagari ↔ English transliteration
4. Rank results by match probability

Matching Logic:

* Loose regex matching
* Phonetic algorithms (Soundex / Metaphone-IN)
* Levenshtein distance
* Token-wise matching

Top most similar names appear first

Results Display

Each result row must show:

* Name
* Age
* Gender
* Booth
* Ward
* EPIC No
* Address

And a PRINT SLIP button

Slip Printing System

* Clicking PRINT passes selected record to backend
* Backend uses **Python + WeasyPrint**
* Generates high-quality printable PDF voter slip
* Return success flag to UI to auto-open PDF
